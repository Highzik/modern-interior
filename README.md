This project is about replicating the main design and making it a responsive design as well.
I copied the design from the Figma website
This is not a group work but an individual one.
In this project, I noticed that the last image at the bottom was placed inside the main image with the css property called position: absolute.
So we used the top, left, right, and bottom to place the image where we want it to be on the page
